# [Environment Variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable)

In Shell, you can have special names that express values under the hood.
In practice for example, you can have a box that holds something,
you can mention it as well that "use the content of that box",
without even have to know about what is actually in the box.
Or an another example is when you have a contact in your phonebook,
and you call this contact all the time,
but you don't remember they actually number out from your head.
Therefore when that contact change they phone number,
you still call them in the same way, and don't have to memorize a new phone number.

Basically this is the same reason why those named variables are being used.
For example you can create a software, that knows, that under "${HOME}",
your current user who run your software have a directory that belongs to that user.
And because every one of your user probably have a slightly different value in that variable,
you less likely want to know the conrete path during when you create your software.
Otherwise, you have to make sure you know every persons home folder path in this globe,
now and in from the future as well.
