# [Variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(computer_science))

## What are they, and why do we need it ?

Variables allow us to work with values that we don't know during the writing the code,
but will be available when our program is running somewhere.

## Examples from real world with real world

In far fetched example, you can have a box that holds something,
You can ask someone to carry that box for you.
Therefore when a moving company come to pick up your belongings,
all they need to know is that you have a couple of box that needs to be
delivered to a new address, without the need to know the content.

In a different usage scenario with variables,
you can have a friend in your contact address book,
you can call that person with your phone, without the need to know the 
phone number of your friend. Therefore when that contact change they phone number,
you still call them in the same way, and don't have to memorize a new phone number.
This is especially good when you have a company phone address book,
and you search a someone by they role. Like HR department.
You don't have to know everyone to know who you need to contact,
in case you have a problem, instead you can use a symbolic group mailing address.
