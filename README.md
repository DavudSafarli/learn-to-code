# Learn to Code

In this repository you will see some learning materials about programming, that probably help you begin your journey.

The goal of this project is to help you learn software engineering through a hands-on, practical approach.

Rather than focusing deeply on theory, we take a different route. 
Your tasks will primarily be structured as [user stories][user-story] and [technical stories][technical-story]. 
This method aims to provide you with value-oriented goals while you work and learn, 
closely mirroring a typical working environment. 
Moreover, these goals offer small milestones to celebrate.

Continuous learning can sometimes feel overwhelming. Without real-world context, you might feel anxious about the value of your knowledge. To avoid a situation where the student gets trapped in a feeling of being unprepared for actual work, we take a different approach, focusing on real-world tasks that mirror work expectations.

To support your work on these realistic tasks, we will provide guidance on the necessary theoretical knowledge for each task.
This will help you stay on track, learn how to learn alongside a task and to build confidence in yourself.
