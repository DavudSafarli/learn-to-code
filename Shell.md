# Shell

In computing, a shell is a user interface for access to an operating system's services.
In general, operating system shells use either a command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI),
depending on a computer's role and particular operation.
It is named a shell because it is the outermost layer around the operating system kernel.
CLI shells require the user to be familiar with commands and their calling syntax,
and to understand concepts about the shell-specific scripting language (for example bash script).
They are also more easily operated via [refreshable braille display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refreshable_braille_display),
and provide certain advantages to screen readers.

Graphical shells place a low burden on beginning computer users,
and are characterized as being easy to use.

Since they also come with certain disadvantages,
most GUI-enabled operating systems also provide CLI shells.

## Windows

The most popular shells being used are
* [Windows Powershell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerShell)
* [Command Prompt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cmd.exe)

## Unix-like environments

Users typically interact with a Unix shell using a [terminal emulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator);
however, direct operation via serial hardware connections or Secure Shell are common for server systems.

The currently most popular shells are:
* [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell))
  * usually can be found on most GNU/Linux environments
* [zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell)
  * A user community website called "Oh My Zsh" collects third-party plug-ins and themes for the Z shell. As of 2018, their GitHub repository has (of varying quality):
    * over 1,000 contributors
    * over 200 plug-ins
    * over 140 themes
    * It also comes with an auto-update tool that makes it easier to keep installed plug-ins and themes updated
* [fish / friendly interactive shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_interactive_shell)
* [ksh / KornShell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KornShell)

All Unix shells provide:
* [filename wildcarding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcard_character)
* [piping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix))
* [here documents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_document)
* [command substitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_substitution)
* [variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(programming))
* [control structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow) for [condition-testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_(programming))
* [iteration capabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteration)
