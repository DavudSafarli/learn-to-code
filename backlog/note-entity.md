# Enable the System to Express a Given Note as Code

As a project team member, you need to enable the system to express a given note as code.
Your goal is to design and implement a domain entity that represents a note in the system, including its attributes and behavior.
A note should have a title and a content.

## Acceptance Criteria

* You can express concrete notes with a Note type as code
* The notes are represented as a domain entity with relevant attributes and behavior

## TODO

* Research and learn about domain entities and their role in the system
* Design a domain entity that represents a note, including its attributes and behavior (e.g. Title, Content, CreatedAt)
