# Enable yourself to be able to work on the project

To start working on the project, you'll need to set up your development environment and get familiar with the tools and processes that will help you collaborate with others.

Your goal is to be able to comfortably modify the project's files, publish changes, and work with others. 
To achieve this, you'll need to complete a series of tasks that will help you get started.

## Acceptance Criteria

* You can comfortably modify the project's files and publish the changes
* You have set up a collaboration environment that allows you to sync and discuss user stories with others
* You can collaborate on code with others in an asynchronous manner

## TODO

* Create a new directory for the project using the command line
* Install Git and initialise a local repository for the project
* Set up a GitHub account and create a new remote repository for the project
* Add at least one collaborator to the repository with write access
* Choose and install a code editor that meets your needs
* Create a Project board (e.g., Trello, Asana, Jira) for tracking user stories and progress
