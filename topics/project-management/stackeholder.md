# Stakeholder

Stakeholders are individuals or groups with an interest in the project.

A stakeholder is anyone with a vested interest in the outcome of a project. 
This includes individuals, groups, or organizations who can be directly 
or indirectly affected by the project's success or failure.

### Examples of Stakeholders:
- **Sponsors**: Those funding the project, such as investors or clients.
- **Regulators**: Government agencies or industry bodies interested in the project's compliance with laws and regulations.
- **Managers**: Project managers, product owners, and other leaders overseeing the project.

### Types of Stakeholders:
- **Internal Stakeholders**: People within the organization working on the project (e.g., team members, managers).
- **External Stakeholders**: People outside the organization working on the project (e.g., customers, sponsors).

### Interacting with Stakeholders:
When people mention "reporting to stakeholders," they usually mean interacting with those overseeing or governing the project. This often refers to:

- **Project Sponsors**: Those funding the project and having a vested interest in its success.
- **Executive Management**: Senior leaders like CEOs, CTOs, or Department Heads responsible for strategic decision-making.
- **Project Governance Board**: A group responsible for overseeing the project's progress, making key decisions, and ensuring alignment with organizational goals.

### Key Focus Areas for Reporting to Stakeholders:
- **Project Progress and Milestones**: Updates on what has been achieved so far.
- **Budget and Financial Performance**: Information on the financial status and how well the project is sticking to the budget.
- **Risks and Issues**: Potential problems that might impact the project.
- **Key Decisions and Recommendations**: Important choices and suggestions for the project's future.

The goal of reporting to stakeholders is to provide them with timely and accurate information, 
enabling them to make informed decisions about the project's direction and resources.
