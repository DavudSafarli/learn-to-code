# **Working on an Issue: A Practical Guide**

Tackling a new task doesn't have to be overwhelming. 
Breaking it down into clear steps will help you manage it effectively and make steady progress.

## Identify What You Need to Start

Before diving into the task, figure out what you need to know or have:

### Key Questions to Ask:
* Do I understand the main concepts involved?
* What technical skills or knowledge are required?
* Is anything unclear in the task? What needs clarification?
* Are there any dependencies on other teams or tools?
* What challenges might I encounter?
* Who can support me?

Challenge any assumptions you might be making,
and stay focused on the essentials by setting aside non-critical questions for later.

## Define What "Done" Looks Like

Knowing when a task is complete ensures you stay focused and deliver quality results.

### Key Considerations:
* What key features or functions must be completed?
* Who will review or approve the work, and what are their expectations?
* What specific outcomes or metrics will indicate the task is complete?

**An Example of Acceptance Criteria could be**:

* The feature is accessible from the main menu.
* A confirmation message appears when the button is clicked.

Acceptance criteria act as a checklist, ensuring that your work meets all necessary requirements.

## Refine and Execute

With your prerequisites and acceptance criteria in place, follow these steps to ensure smooth execution:

### Steps to Take:

* **Break down the task**: Divide it into smaller, manageable sub-tasks.
  * This creates clear milestones and helps you maintain focus.
* **Monitor and adjust**: Regularly review your progress and make adjustments as needed.
  * If you hit a roadblock, don't hesitate to reach out for help.
  * Consider setting aside time to review your work periodically to catch any potential issues early.

## Example

Let's say we have the following user story in our backlog:
> "As a user, I want to tag my notes to easily organise and track related topics."

To get started, let's identify what we need to know or understand about this user story.

* What is meant by "tagging" in this context?
* How will users interact with the tagging feature?
* Are there any specific technical skills or knowledge required to implement tagging?

After some analysis, our readiness prerequisites might look like this:

* Familiarity with front-end development to introduce a tag-based search filter on the notes page
* Understanding of how to interact with a database to store and retrieve tags
* Knowledge of how to design a user interface for tagging notes

Now that we have identified our prerequisites, 
let's define what are the acceptance criterial in order to consider our user story done.

* The tagging feature is accessible from the notes page.
* Users can add and remove tags from individual notes.
* The search filter updates in real-time to reflect tagged notes.
* Tags are stored in the database and retrieved correctly.
* The user interface for tagging notes is intuitive and easy to use.

To implement this feature, we might break down the task into smaller sub-tasks:

* Design a user interface for tagging notes
* Implement front-end logic for adding and removing tags
* Update the search filter to reflect tagged notes
* Store and retrieve tags in the database
