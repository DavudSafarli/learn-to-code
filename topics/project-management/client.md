# **What is a Client?**

In simple terms, a client is someone or something that uses your software or service. 
They're the ones who interact with your application, website, or API.

Think of it like this: when you build a web app, someone needs to use it in order for it to be useful. 
That someone is called a client. 
They can be a person using a browser on their computer or phone, 
or they can be another software system that interacts with your API.

## Types

- **End-User Client**: This is a person who uses your software directly. For example, if you build a mobile app for ordering food, the people who download and use the app are end-user clients.
- **Server-Side Client**: This is another software system that interacts with your server or API. For example, if you build an e-commerce platform and another company wants to integrate their payment gateway with your platform, their system would be a server-side client.
- **Business Client**: This is a company or organization that uses your software as part of their business operations. For example, if you build a project management tool for teams, the companies that buy and use your tool are business clients.

## Why is it Important to Understand Who Your Clients Are?

Understanding who your clients are helps you design and build better software. By knowing what they need and how they'll be using your application, you can create features that meet their requirements and provide a good user experience.

Additionally, identifying different types of clients can help you develop strategies for supporting and communicating with them effectively. For example, you may need to provide different levels of technical support or documentation depending on the type of client.
