* [Cultivating Habits for a Growth-Oriented Mindset](/topics/programming/foundation/ThinkingHabits.md)
    - Embrace vulnerability; seek clarity by asking questions and accelerate your learning speed
    - Establish a solid knowledge base before progressing to more advanced concepts
    - Overcome your fears
        - Fear of the unknown is a natural response, but courage is honed when you challenge these fears.
        - Venture outside your comfort zone, even when failure seems probable.

## Foundations of Programming

- Selecting Your First Programming Language
    - Opt for a general-purpose programming language with a concise specification.
      For instance, Go is a recommended choice due to its intentional simplicity,
      which masks complexity without concealing implementation details,
      thanks to its imperative language nature.

- Setting Up Your Development Environment
    - Install the chosen programming language on your machine.
    - Install a code editor:
        - [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
        - [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

- Understanding Control Statements
    - Conditional Statements
        - if/else
        - switch/case
    - Loops and Iteration
        - for / loop / foreach
        - while / until
        - break / continue

- Introduction to the 'goto' Statement
    - It's not essential to use, but it's useful to understand the 'goto' statement for when you come across it.

- Delving into Package Management
    - Understanding Packages
    - The Rationale Behind Using Third-Party Packages
    - Discovering Packages
        - The `awesome` collections are usually a great starting point to explore new packages.
        - Community-driven package distribution platforms.

- Grasping Visibility
    - Levels of Visibility
        - Private/Protected (Unexported)
        - Public (Exported)

- Structuring
    - Classes/Structures
        - Methods
    - Singleton Functions

## Design

- Test Driven Development
    - What is TDD

- Design principle frameworks:
    - Clean Architecture
    - Domain Driven Design
    - Hexagonal Architecture

## Philosophy

* [The Unix Philosophy](topics/programming/foundation/UnixPhilosophy.md)
* Understanding first the reason why a given programming language was invented helps to understand its design.
