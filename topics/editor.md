A code editor, also known as an integrated development environment (IDE), is a software application that provides a platform for writing, editing, and managing source code. It is an essential tool for developers, programmers, and coders to create, modify, and debug their code.

## Key Features

- **Text Editing**: A code editor allows you to write, edit, and manipulate text-based code.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: The editor highlights the syntax of the programming language, making it easier to read and understand.
- **Auto-Completion**: Many editors provide auto-completion features that suggest possible completions for your code as you type.
- **Code Navigation**: This feature allows you to go to declarations and follow function paths making it easier to find your way around in the codebase.
- **Code Folding**: This feature allows you to collapse or expand sections of code, making it easier to navigate large files.
- **Debugging Tools**: Some editors include debugging tools, such as breakpoints and console output, to help identify and fix errors.

## Types

- **Text-Based Editors**: Simple text-based editors that provide basic editing features, such as Notepad or TextEdit.
- **IDEs (Integrated Development Environments)**: Comprehensive environments that include a range of tools for development, debugging, and testing, such as Eclipse or Visual Studio.
- **Code-Only Editors**: Lightweight editors that focus on code writing and editing, with minimal distractions, such as Lapce.
