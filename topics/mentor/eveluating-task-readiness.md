# **Evaluating Readiness of a User Story: A Pragmatic Approach**

As a mentor, your role is not only to assess the student's technical knowledge but also to guide them in applying their skills to real-world scenarios. When evaluating the readiness of a user story, focus on the student's ability to gather requirements, make informed decisions, and communicate effectively.

Let's take the example of the `NoteDown` project, where the student is tasked with presenting hardware and device requirements to stakeholders. The goal is not to test the student's lexical knowledge of computer hardware but to assess their ability to understand the stakeholder's needs and provide a suitable solution.

> Focus to on achieve a **conversation** with the student rather than doing an **interrogation**.

When playing the roles such as a `stakeholder`, 
avoid interrogating the student about technical details such as CPU cycles or IT fundamentals. 
Instead, engage in a conversation that simulates real-world interactions. 
Ask open-ended questions that encourage the student to gather requirements and think critically about the project's needs.

## Example Conversation

- Stakeholder (Mentor): "I'm really looking forward to seeing NoteDown in action. I've been using paper notebooks for years, but I think it's time we go digital. What kind of project are we envisioning here?"
- Student: "Can you tell me more about what you mean by 'going digital'? Are you looking for a specific type of application or workflow?"
- Stakeholder (Mentor): "Well, I like the idea of being able to access my notes from anywhere, and I've heard that web apps are great for that. But at the same time, I love the tactile feel of typing on a keyboard. Do you think we could create something that combines those two experiences?"
- Student: "That sounds like an interesting challenge. To achieve a web-based application with a keyboard-driven interface, I would suggest using a computer with a monitor and keyboard. We could also consider using a cloud-based storage solution to enable access from anywhere."
- Stakeholder (Mentor): "I like the sound of that. You know what would be even better? If it felt more like using an old-fashioned teletype machine, where I can just start typing away without having to worry about formatting or anything else. Can we make it feel like that?"
- Student: "I think I see where you're going with this. We could definitely create a simple, text-based interface that's reminiscent of a teletype machine. And since we're using a monitor and keyboard setup, we can ensure that the typing experience feels responsive and tactile."

## **Key Takeaways**

When evaluating the readiness of a user story:

1. **Focus on application, not theory**: Assess the student's ability to apply their knowledge in real-world scenarios.
2. **Encourage conversation over interrogation**: Engage in open-ended discussions that simulate real-world interactions.
3. **Gather requirements, not definitions**: Focus on understanding the stakeholder's needs rather than testing technical vocabulary.

By taking a pragmatic approach, you'll help students develop essential skills for software engineering, such as critical thinking, communication, and problem-solving.
