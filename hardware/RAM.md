# [Random-access memory (RAM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory)

RAM is the place where the short - term memorization happen in case of the brain.
This is like when you hear something new during a day, that you cannot match with something you already know,
or it is not that easy, so you remember about it for a certain period of time.

The "random" part here means that when you need something that you memorized for a given "address",
you can receive it back directly without the need for searching it in the memory.
Basically when you memorize the restaurant WC password from the receipt, at the door,
you don't have to think trough everything what you remember until you find the code,
but only think about the "wc password from the receipt", and you got it.
I fear such scenario would be troublesome otherwise.

Using short-term memory is much faster and easier for both the brain and the computer,
than the long-term memory, but more about that later.

Modern RAMs can only keep they supplied with electricity.
So if your power off / restart that device, the RAM will lose its content.

## [Clock Speed meaning for ram (MHz)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR_SDRAM)

MHz of RAM is the maximum number of clock cycles per second that the RAM operates on.
With Double Data Rate (DDR) RAM, it actually communicates twice per cycle.
This is why chips are now named for their bandwidth, not their frequency alone.
It's still necessary to know the clock rate, to ensure that the motherboard/CPU can operate at that clock.

Example with a 200 MHz DDR (PC-3200):
> 200 MHz clock rate × 2 (for DDR, 1 for SDR) × 8 Bytes = 3,200 MB/s bandwidth
