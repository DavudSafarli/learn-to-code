# Hardware Summary

There are a few components in the commonly available personal computers, that I would like to mention.
This will be a high level, oversimplified summary.

For the sake of representation, I will make references about
similarities between the purpose of a hardware components and the behavior of the brain for such tasks.
Again, it will be oversimplified, and the examples will be not 100% correct from Neuroscience point of view.
While 1:1 references are inaccurate, it will be still good for representation.

## [Central processing unit (CPU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit)

CPU performs the basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions.
This is when the brain try to use mathematics, answer a yes or no question or doing REM during night.
Almost anything the computer **do actively** is usually done by the CPU, except I/O operations.

## [Random-access memory (RAM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory)

RAM is the place where the short - term memorization happen in case of the brain.
This is like when you hear something new during a day, that you cannot match with something you already know,
or it is not that easy, so you remember about it for a certain period of time.

The "random" part here means that when you need something that you memorized for a given "address",
you can receive it back directly without the need for searching it in the memory.
Basically when you memorize the restaurant WC password from the receipt, at the door,
you don't have to think trough everything what you remember until you find the code,
but only think about the "wc password from the receipt", and you got it.
I fear such scenario would be troublesome otherwise.

Using short-term memory is much faster and easier for both the brain and the computer,
than the long-term memory, but more about that later.

Modern RAMs can only keep they supplied with electricity.
So if your power off / restart that device, the RAM will lose its content.

# [Input/Output (I/O or IO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output)

Inputs are the signals or data received by the system and outputs are the signals or data sent from it.
The term can also be used as part of an action; to "perform I/O" is to perform an input or output operation.
Oversimplifying it, this is communication between anything that is not CPU or RAM.
This includes network communication (e.g. internet),
or reading content from your storage device (place where your files live on your PC).

## [Local Storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_storage)

This device sole purpose is to provide the computer with long term memory.
These devices usually much more slower than RAM.
This is usually not a big deal, because most modern [operation systems](OperationSystemFundamentals.md) try to keep things in RAM,
and do as many as reasonable I/O operation together on the local storage.

It is like when you think hard to remember something you don't often use,
when you finally remember it, your brain put a working-copy of that information into your short-term memory,
so if you need it with in a given time, you still can easily remember about it.
Also when you learn things during the day, you will most likely memorize it in your long-term memory during your sleep's [REM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement_sleep).
