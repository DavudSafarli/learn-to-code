- [ ] **Create tutorial on getting familiar with storing values in memory**:
	* Write a tech story for young engineers to learn about storing values in memory.
	* Focus on introducing the concept and having them experiment with it.
- [ ] **Create tutorial on repository pattern without abstraction**:
	* Write a second tech story that introduces the repository pattern without any abstraction.
	* Have young engineers implement a simple repository pattern using an in-memory storage solution.
- [ ] **Introduce abstraction to replace current solution**:
	* Create a new step where users realize they are losing data due to the current solution.
	* Introduce the concept of abstraction and have young engineers replace the current solution with a file storage based one.
- [ ] **Introduce IO concepts and limitations**:
	* Use the file storage based solution as an opportunity to teach young engineers about IO concepts and limitations.
- [ ] **Introduce web nodes running in parallel**:
	* Create a new step where young engineers learn about multiple web nodes running in parallel.
	* Show how this affects the current solution (file storage) and introduce a better solution.
